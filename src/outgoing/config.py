# <https://github.com/samuelcolvin/pydantic/issues/975>
class Password(pydantic.SecretStr):
    """
    A subclass of `pydantic.SecretStr` that accepts ``outgoing`` password
    specifiers as input and automatically resolves them using
    `resolve_password()`.  Host, username, and ``configpath`` values are passed
    to `resolve_password()` as follows:

    - If `Password` is subclassed and given a ``host`` class variable naming a
      field, and if the subclass is then used in a model where a field with
      that name is declared before the `Password` subclass field, then when the
      model is instantiated, the value of the named field will be passed as the
      ``host`` argument to `resolve_password()`.

    - Alternatively, `Password` can be subclassed with ``host`` set to a class
      callable (a classmethod or staticmethod), and when that subclass is used
      in a model being instantiated, the callable will be passed a `dict` of
      all validated fields declared before the password field; the return value
      from the callable will then be passed as the ``host`` argument to
      `resolve_password()`.

    - If `Password` is used in a model without being subclassed, or if ``host``
      is not defined in a subclass, then `None` will be passed as the ``host``
      argument to `resolve_password()`.

    - The ``username`` argument to `resolve_password()` can likewise be defined
      by subclassing `Password` and defining ``username`` appropriately.

    - If there is a field named ``configpath`` declared before the `Password`
      field, then the value of ``configpath`` is passed to
      `resolve_password()`.

    For example, if writing a pydantic model for a sender configuration where
    the host-analogue value is passed in a field named ``"service"`` and for
    which the username is always ``"__token__"``, you would subclass `Password`
    like this:

    .. code:: python

        class MyPassword(outgoing.Password):
            host = "service"

            @staticmethod
            def username(values: Dict[str, Any]) -> str:
                return "__token__"


    and then use it in your model like so:

    .. code:: python

        class MySender(pydantic.BaseModel):
            configpath: Optional[outgoing.Path]
            service: str
            password: MyPassword  # Must come after `configpath` and `service`!
            # ... other fields ...

    Then, when ``MySender`` is instantiated, the input to the ``password``
    field would be automatically resolved by doing (effectively):

    .. code:: python

        my_sender.password = pydantic.SecretStr(
            resolve_password(
                my_sender.password,
                host=my_sender.service,
                username="__token__",
                configpath=my_sender.configpath,
            )
        )

    .. note::

        As this is a subclass of `pydantic.SecretStr`, the value of a
        `Password` field is retrieved by calling its ``get_secret_value()``
        method.
